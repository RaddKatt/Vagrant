# Vagrant - Getting Started
This will place a Vagrantfile in your current directory:
```shell
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
```
Example:
<pre>
<b>$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64<b>
  A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
  ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
  the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
  `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.</pre>
