# Vagrant - Getting Started
This will place a Vagrantfile in your current directory:
```shell
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
```
Example:
```
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
```
```
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```
