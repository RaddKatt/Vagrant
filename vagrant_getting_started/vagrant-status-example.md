# Example: vagrant status
Use `vagrant status` to check whether a machine is up or down.

<code><b>$ vagrant status</b><code>
Current machine states:

default                   running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.</code></code>
